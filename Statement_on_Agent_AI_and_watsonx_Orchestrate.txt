How We Utilized Agentic AI & IBM watsonx Orchestrate I(bob & I) did not just build a chatbot; We built a Multi-Agent System coordinated entirely by IBM watsonx Orchestrate.

1. The Orchestration Layer: We used watsonx Orchestrate to define the "SQL Lifecycle" workflow. It manages the state and handoffs between three specialized agents, ensuring no single agent has unchecked access to the database.

2. The Agentic Architecture:

Agent A (The Generator): A native watsonx agent using IBM Granite to translate natural language into SQL.

Agent B (The Enforcer): A custom "Guardian" agent powered by IBM Granite Guardian 3.0. It does not generate text; it classifies intent (Malicious/Safe) and cross-references it with deterministic Db2 rules.

Agent C (The Optimizer): A specialist agent that analyzes "Safe" SQL for performance bottlenecks (missing indexes, table scans) and rewrites the query for speed.

This architecture moves beyond simple "RAG" into true Agentic AI, where autonomous actors collaborate to achieve a goal (Safe Data Retrieval) that none could achieve alone.  My personal take is that it would take 50X the effort to do without leveraging watson Orchestrate.
